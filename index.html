                    <span class="bold-please">Beda: </span>Hi guys! I am a senior studying Communication Arts
                    (Radio-Television-Film)
                    with certificates in Cinema Production, Digital Studies, and Textile and Fashion Design. I've
                    previously taken courses about the digital world and how everyone has a different experience
                    depending on their identity, location, and access. I've had very minimal experiene with HTML and
                    CSS, but I have always been interested in learning the ins and outs of website deisgn. I hope
                    that
                    this course will continue to teach me new insights into how the digital world functions
                    differently
                    given different elements, and how I can contribute to making the internet a more functional and
                    better space. For the first assignment, I decided to look into Angie Jones, who is also known as
                    @techgirl1908 on Twitter. She is the founder of Diva Chix and has worked closesly with helping
                    to
                    introduce younger women into the tech world.

                    <span class="bold-please">Cade: </span>Hi everyone! I am a senior at UW
                    Madison studying Computer
                    Science.
                    I am particulary interested in web development and hope to one day make it my full time career.
                    I already know a little about web development going into this course, but I am not as familar
                    with the social constructs in the tech industry. Therefore, I hope to better prepare myself for
                    the
                    real world by taking this class. Most of my tech heros or heros in general are self made
                    entrepreneurs, so for this Assignment I chose to write about
                    <a href="trecia_kat.html">Trecia Kat</a>, a 20 year old web developer who has made quite the
                    name
                    for herself using Twitter! I hope that you will find learning about her as interesting as I did,
                    and I look forward to any feedback about the website you might have.

            <h2 class="home-content-blurb-title">The Interview</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-please">Interview Process: </span> We met on Zoom! We talked about who we are,
                    what interests on
                    in this course, what we hope to gain out of it, and who our tech heroes are. The conversation went
                    smoothly and we got to know one another well. It was interesting hearing about eachothers tech heros
                    and why we look up to them as role models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-please">Issues: </span> The only issue we faced during our interview process was
                    making sure we
                    were meeting the time requirement for the assignment, as it was difficult to know how much time had
                    passed during our conversation. Beda had to edit the video a little bit to make sure it wasn't too
                    long, as we ended talking for much longer than anticipated!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold-please">Outcome: </span> The outcome of the interview was meeting a new friend and
                    learning about
                    eachother and their tech heros. It went so well that we decided to partner up and make this awesome
                    website to showcase our heros and what we talked about!

                    <span class="bold-please">1. Feedback Process: </span> Thank you everyone for your thoughtful
                    feedback and compliments on Canvas! We took each that suggestion you made into consideration and
                    have
                    updated the website accordingly. It definetly looks more aesthetically pleasing now. Sometimes
                    you need an outsiders perspective to notice small details.

                <p>
                    <span class="bold-please">2. Moving Forward: </span> We next plan to start working on the
                    responsiveness
                    of the website and ensuring continuity of structure across pages. We look forward to hearing your
                    feedback again!
